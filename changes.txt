    Met w/ Harmon about graph issue

    Equation is fixed
    After conferring, realized that the issue is probably with my current python code
        Not the equation, this mathces the mathematica code
        RWMath.py within mathematica also matches mathematica code
        Therefore it must be something with RW.py
