# Random Walks GUI Simulation

## Simulation
When RWoperation is first called, it will create a given memory block in shared memory if one does not already exist.
This memory block will hold 

# Ports to communicate readiness for read / write
# Shared memory to access data
# Movement change, no rounding error
